      I’m sorry to hear that 😢.  
      Everyone feels sad sometimes — that’s part of being human.  
      When you feel low, it can help to move a bit, listen to music, or talk about it.  
      Do you want to tell me what made you feel this way?

    <that>Do you want me to tell you how exercise can also help your mood?</that>
    <template>
      Definitely! 🏃‍♀️  
      Physical activity makes your body release “happy chemicals” called <b>endorphins</b>.  
      They help reduce stress and make you feel more confident.  
      Even small movements — like dancing, stretching, or walking — can boost your mood!  
      What kind of activities do you like to do?

    <template>
      Great question! 🥗 + 🏃‍♀️ = 💥  
      Food gives your body <b>fuel</b>, and exercise uses that fuel to make you stronger.  
      Eating healthy foods before and after being active helps your muscles recover.  
      For example:  
      🍌 Before activity → a banana or yogurt gives you energy.  
      🍳 After → a mix of protein and carbs (like eggs and toast) helps rebuild strength.

      Sure thing 🍽️  
      A balanced meal includes:  
      🥦 <b>Vegetables</b> and <b>Fruits</b> — full of vitamins.  
      🍞 <b>Whole Grains</b> — energy that lasts.  
      🥚 <b>Protein</b> — builds your muscles.  
      🧈 <b>Healthy Fats</b> — helps your brain and skin.  
      💧 <b>Water</b> — keeps you hydrated!  
      Balance is about variety and color — your plate should look like a rainbow 🌈

      Sure 🍭!  
      It’s okay to eat all kinds of food — but some are “sometimes” foods.  
      ⚠️ Try not to have too much of:  
      – Sugary drinks and sodas  
      – Fried or fast foods  
      – Candy and pastries  
      They taste good, but can make you tired or affect your focus.  
      Remember: moderation is key 💛
