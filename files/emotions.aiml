      Sure 🍎  
      When we’re angry, our body releases stress hormones.  
      Eating heavy or sugary foods can make you feel even more upset later.  
      Instead, try:  
      🍵 A tea, 🍌 a banana, or 🥗 light vegetables — they calm your body.  
      Small food choices can make a big emotional difference 🌿
