  <!-- Healthy Food -->
  <category>
    <pattern>HEALTHY FOOD</pattern>
    <template>
      Eating healthy means balancing your meals with fruits 🍓, vegetables 🥦, proteins 🍗, and water 💧.  
      Would you like me to give you examples of healthy snacks?
    </template>

  <category>
    <pattern>YES HEALTHY SNACKS</pattern>
    <template>
      Great! Try apple slices with peanut butter, yogurt with fruit, or a handful of nuts.  
      Do you often eat snacks when you feel hungry or bored?

    <pattern>JUNK FOOD</pattern>
    <template>
      Junk food is tasty but not very good for your body if you eat too much.  
      It can make you feel tired or moody. Try to keep it as an occasional treat!

  <!-- Physical Activity -->
  <category>
    <pattern>PHYSICAL ACTIVITY</pattern>
    <template>
      Physical activity helps your body and mind stay strong 💪.  
      Teens should move at least 60 minutes per day — dancing, cycling, walking, or playing sports.  
      What kind of activity do you enjoy?

  <category>
    <pattern>I DON T LIKE SPORTS</pattern>
    <template>
      That’s okay! Not everyone loves sports.  
      You can still move — dance in your room, walk your dog, or stretch a bit.  
      Moving even 10 minutes can boost your mood and energy!

  <!-- Emotional Dimension -->
  <category>
    <pattern>EMOTIONS</pattern>
    <template>
      Emotions are important! Eating well and staying active can help you feel happier and calmer 🌈.  
      How do you usually feel when you eat healthy food or exercise?

    <pattern>I FEEL SAD</pattern>
    <template>
      I'm sorry you're feeling sad 💙.  
      Sometimes emotions affect what we eat or how much we move.  
      Would you like a few ideas to cheer yourself up in a healthy way?

      🧘‍♀️ Breathe deeply for one minute.  
      🎵 Listen to your favorite song.  
      🧑‍🍳 Make a colorful snack.  
      💬 Talk to a friend.  
      Small actions can make a big difference!
